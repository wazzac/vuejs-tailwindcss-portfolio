By day, I'm passionate about crafting clean and efficient code, particularly with PHP projects and building RESTful APIs. I'm currently diving deep into the worlds of Yii2 and Laravel frameworks, constantly learning and expanding my skillset. I also enjoy working with databases and data management in general. In my spare time, I love working on my own open-source projects and would be thrilled if others would fork and help improve them.",

When I'm on dry land, you might find me grappling on the BJJ mats, cheering on the Springboks or Blue Bulls (champions all the way!), or spending quality time with my amazing wife and two fantastic kids."
